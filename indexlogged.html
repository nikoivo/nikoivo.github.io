                        Hearthstone is Blizzard's newest attempt at getting in on the free-to-play market.
                        It's a fairly casual, card-based game in which each player takes turns playing cards from their hand.
                        These cards will have various effects, and are used to take your opponent down to 0 health, winning the game.
                        It starts out fairly simply. You're thrust into a tutorial several missions long to get the hang of the game.
                        The AI throws out some comical dialogue, and you learn while you laugh at it a bit. The gameplay is very easy to learn,
                        and while it may seem a bit two-dimensional to trading card game veterans, it still has a lot to offer.
                        Once you beat the tutorial, you have the option of choosing to battle against one of 9 different classes, unlocking each upon beating it.
                        Each one has a set of cards unique to it, along with many that can be used by any class. Each class also has a distinct play style;
                        a method of victory that they excel at.
